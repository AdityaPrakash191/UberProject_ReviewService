1. API ( Application Programming Interface) : 
an api is a piece of code that is exposing some internal business functionality to the outside world so that they can use it.

2. REST (Representational State Transfer) :
It is a set of recommendation to prepare modern web api's.

It defines kind of like a style guide to make api's (like free ka advise).

If we follow Rest API convention then :-

	• a) our apis become more consistent, readable, standard that a lot of developers use.

	• b) it provides independent implementation. It is more oriented towards design of API.

	• Like REST we have certain other recommendations SOAP , grpc.

	• c) REST is most widely accepted

	• d)frameworks like ( Rails ,Django etc ) heavily tied with rest.

	• e) easy to get started with.

# Principles of Rest
	• All the api's are designed around resource.
	• Here resource means any kind of object, data, service or real life entity that can access.
	• Your routes should be based on resource like : /products /customers /orders/2 /categories
	• If you want to send and receive data use json format for it.
	• json means java-script object notation, It is just a data format. like .txt
	
	3. If you want to send data from client to server then, there are 3 ways
	• Query Params - key : value pairs separated by &. Usually used for filtering.
	• URL Params - (PATH Params) products/23 , todo/21 , todo/4
	• Body Params - 

	4. REST suggest for any resource we can make CRUD Apis.
	
Fun Fact : Browser understand html in order to render the stuffs, html forms only supports get and post methods for networks calls.
If we want put, patch, delete it is done by javascript in the browser.
